Changes in 0.5.5:

 * Put genuine search encoding back into the nad algorithm, and
   further clean up the nad code.  Literals are now sent out using a
   literal buffer integrated with the input mapptr so that data is not
   copied.  Checksums are still calculated from scratch each time
   rather than by rolling -- this is very slow but simple.

 * Reshuffle test cases so that they use files generated by hsmapread,
   rather than the source directory.  This makes the tests quicker and
   more reproducible, hopefully without losing coverage.  Further
   develop the test driver framework.

 * Add hsdumpsums debugging tool.

 * Hex strings (eg strong checksums) are broken up by underscores for
   readability. 

 * Stats now go to the log rather than stdout.

 * mapptr acts properly when we're skipping/rewinding to data already
   present in the buffer -- it does a copy if required, but not
   necessarily real IO.

Changes in 0.5.4:

 * Improved mapptr input code

 * Turn on more warnings if using gcc 

 * More test cases

Changes in 0.5.3:

 * Improvements to mapptr to make it work better for network IO. 
 
 * Debug trace code is compiled in unless turned off in ./configure
   (although most programs will not write it out unless asked.)

 * Add libhsyncinfo program to show compiled-in settings and version.

 * Add test cases that run across localhost TCP sockets.

 * Improved build code; should now build easily from CVS through
   autogen.sh.

 * Improved trace code.

 * Clean up to build on sparc-sun-solaris2.8, and in the process clean
   up the handling of bytes vs chars, and of building without gcc

 * Reverse build scripts so that driver.sh calls the particular
   script.

Changes in 0.5.2:

 * Use mapptr for input. 

 * Implement a new structure for encoding in nad.c.  It doesn't 
   encode at the moment, but it's much more maintainable.

 * More regression cases.

 * Clean up build process.

Changes in 0.5.0:

 * Rewrite hs_inbuf and hs_encode to make them simpler and more
   reliable. 

 * Test cases for input handling.

 * Use the map_ptr idea for input from both streams and files.

Changes in 0.4.1:

 * automake/autoconf now works cleanly when the build directory is
   different to the source directory.

 * --enable-ccmalloc works again.

Changes in 0.4.0:

* A much better regression suite.

* CHECKSUM token includes the file's checksum up to the current
  location, to aid in self-testing.

* Various bug fixes, particularly to do with short IO returns.
