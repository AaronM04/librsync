 * Try to make libhsync more generally useful

   * Tease apart the different algorithms inside the library so that
     they can be independently re-used.

   * Use more specific names than `encode' and `decode'.  I like
     `apply' as a description of what the client does. 

   * Don't imply any particular encoding format.  I don't think we
     need callbacks; it's enough that all the users can write their
     own implementations of the loops.

   * This ought to make it simpler to get push-structured interfaces. 

 * More thorough testing

   * mdfour

     * keep some example files and check that they give the expected
       results. 

     * try using different input chunk sizes

   * abstract i/o

     * rewrite cat to use our routines, and make sure it passes the
       file through correctly however we call it.  Different
       strategies are possible: using the loop functions or not, using
       mapptrs, etc.
