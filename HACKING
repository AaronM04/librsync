Instructions for people wanting to work on librsync.  Please consider
them even if you're doing your own fork.

 * If you make a significant change (of more than 15 lines, say), then
   add yourself to the copyright for that file, and to the AUTHORS file.

 * NEWS contains a list of user-visible changes in the library in each
   version.  This includes changes to the way it's packaged, bug
   fixes, portability notes, changes to the API, and so on.  Add items
   as you go along, so that we don't need to work out what happened
   when it's time for a release.

 * ChangeLog contains a list of detailed developer-visible changes.
   See the GNU Coding Standards for a description of what ought to go
   in here.  Please put your changes in here even though they're
   likely to duplicate your CVS commit messages.  It makes it a lot
   easier if people ever create their own trees away from the central
   CVS server.

 * Please try to update docs and tests in parallel with code changes.
