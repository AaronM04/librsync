Instructions and conventions for people wanting to work on librsync.
Also read README.CVS for detailed instructions and requirements on
working with CVS. Please consider these guidelines even if you're
doing your own fork. 

 * If you make a significant change (of more than 15 lines, say), then
   add yourself to the copyright for that file, and to the AUTHORS file.

 * THANKS contains a list of contributors for each release. If someone
   contributed a patch or bugreport, please add them under a
   "Contributors for X.Y.Z" heading at the bottom of the file.

 * NEWS contains a list of user-visible changes in the library between
   releases version. This includes changes to the way it's packaged,
   bug fixes, portability notes, changes to the API, and so on. Add
   and update items under a "Changes in X.Y.Z" heading at the top of
   the file. Do this as you go along, so that we don't need to work
   out what happened when it's time for a release.

 * ChangeLog contains a list of detailed developer-visible change in
   GNU Coding Standards format. It is not included in CVS, but is
   auto-generated from CVS commit messages and included in the
   distribution tar-ball. Please keep this in mind when entering your
   CVS commit messages. Meaningful commit messages will ensure a
   useful Changelog, which makes it a lot easier if people ever create
   their own trees away from the central CVS server.

 * Please try to update docs and tests in parallel with code changes.
