\section intro Introduction

This is an library for rsync-encoding, designed to be easily
embedded into diverse applications.  \em libhsync is being
developed as part of the \b rproxy <http://rproxy.samba.org/>
and \b rsync <http://rsync.samba.org/> projects.

libhsync encapsulates the core algorithms of the rsync
protocol, which help with efficient calculation of the
differences between two files.  The rsync algorithm is different
from most differencing algorithms in that it does not require
the presence of the two files to calculate the delta.  Instead,
it requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which
together form a signature for that file.  Blocks at any in the
other file which have the same checksum are likely to be
identical, and whatever remains is the difference.

The library does not deal with file metadata or structure, such as
filenames, permissions, or directories. To this library, a file is
just a stream of bytes.  Higher-level tools, such as rsync
<http://rsync.samba.org> can deal with such issues in a way
appropriate to their users.

The library supports three basic operations:

   -# Generating the signature S of a file A .
   -# Calculating a delta D from S and a new file B.
   -# Applying D to A to reconstruct B.

The library also provides the \ref rdiff command-line tool.

\section overview Overview

Why not start with hs_mksum_begin() and ::hs_job_t?

\section api Programming Interface

The main public interface to libhsync is through the hsync.h header
file.

The programming interface to libhsync is similar to that of zlib and
bzlib.

All public symbols in the library have the prefix
``<tt>hs_</tt>''. Symbols for internal use only have the prefix
``<tt>_hs_</tt>''.

<p>The library contains three basic types of functions:
low-level delta routines, higher-level wrappers, and utility
routines.  There is also a single executable, <tt>rdiff</tt>,
which makes the library functions accessible from scripts or the
command line.

<p>The main routines are all streaming: they gradually
accumulate data or produce output as the file is processed.</p>

<p>The current library code always uses an encoding format
documented in the <it>hsync Protocol Definition</it> document.
Other formats may be supported in the future.</p>

\subsection mksum Generate Signature

Functions that generate signatures read from the file whose signature
will be taken.  Signature data is written out to another stream as it
is produced.

\subsection readsig Read Signature

Reads from a signature stream and produces an in-memory
signature structure.

\subsection lowlevel Low-level interface

Low level functions compress data in memory, between caller-specified
input and output buffers.  They do no IO and have minimum dependencies
on the C library.  This is useful for applications that already have
your own IO framework, which is the case for Apache, Squid, etc.
Because data is taken as required by the application, they can
interoperate with non-blocking IO and encryption libraries, amongst
other things.

All encoding routines follow a calling protocol similar to that of
zlib: the caller passes the address and length of input and output
buffers, plus an opaque state object.  Each routine processes as
much data as possible, and returns when the input buffer is empty
or the output buffer is full.

\section highlevel High-level Interface

The high-level interface works similarly to the C library's stdio
routines, and builds upon them.  It is simpler to use, and appropriate
for applications that do not need to filter or throttle their IO.

\subsection api_trace Debugging Trace

libhsync can output trace or log messages as it proceeds.  These
follow a fairly standard priority-based filtering system
(hs_trace_set_level()), using the same severity levels as UNIX syslog.
Messages by default are sent to stderr, but may be passed to an
application-provided callback (hs_trace_to(), hs_trace_fn_t()).
