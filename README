libhsync is the next generation of librsync, and provides flexible
checksum-based differencing.  The main application at the moment in
rproxy, but the library should eventually be generally useful.

As of 0.4, development is concentrated on building a full regression
suite.

  * cc 
  * Make
  * libc-dev

To build from CVS, or to develop the library:

  * automake
  * autoconf
  * libtool

>> Library Versions

libhsync uses the GNU libtool library versioning system, so the

library release and version, use the libhsyncinfo tool.
