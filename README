libhsync is the next generation of librsync, and provides flexible
checksum-based differencing.  The main application at the moment in
rproxy, but the library should eventually be generally useful.

>> Requirements

To build libhsync:

  * cc 
  * Make
  * libc-dev

>> Library Versions

libhsync uses the GNU libtool library versioning system, so the
filename does not correspond to the libhsync release.  To show the
library release and version, use the libhsyncinfo tool.

>> Platforms

libhsync/rproxy is known to run on:

GNU Linux Debian 2.2 x86

SUNWspro: (use -v for more warnings)

mips-sgi-irix6.5: works, but you must use GNU Make rather than the
default SGI Make.  I used gcc.
